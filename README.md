Prediction Market for Real-World Events
Project Description
A decentralized prediction market platform built on blockchain technology that allows users to create and participate in markets predicting real-world events. The platform enables users to buy shares in potential outcomes, with rewards distributed to those who correctly predict event results.
Project Vision
Our vision is to create a transparent, accessible, and efficient prediction market that harnesses the wisdom of crowds to provide accurate forecasting for a wide range of events. By eliminating intermediaries and using smart contracts to automate market operations, we aim to provide a trustless platform where participants from anywhere in the world can engage in prediction markets with minimal fees and maximum security.
Key Features

Market Creation: Create prediction markets for any real-world event with customizable parameters
Share Purchase: Buy shares in "Yes" or "No" outcomes using cryptocurrency
Oracle Resolution: Designated oracles resolve markets based on real-world outcomes
Automated Reward Distribution: Smart contract automatically calculates and distributes rewards
Low Fee Structure: Minimal platform fees to encourage participation
Transparent Operations: All market data is publicly visible on the blockchain

Core Smart Contract Functions
